Operator precedence:

Postfix	Expr++ Expr--
Unary	++expr --expr + expr -expr
Multiplicative	X / %
Additive	+ -
Shift	<<>> >>>
Relational	<> <=> = instanceof
Equality	== !=
Bitwise AND	&
Bitwise exclusive OR	^
Bitwise inclusive OR 	|
Logical AND	&&
Logical OR	||
Ternary	?:
Assignment	= += -+ x= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=



If we use operators of equal precedence, they are evaluated from left to right, but if those operators are assignment operators then they are evaluated from right to left.
